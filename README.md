## Movie app displayed using pagination
1. The component should make a request to the movie api and build a pagination component
2. The design should be fully responsive
3. The first and last buttons should be disabled as long as we are not in the last and first page available.
4. The next and previous buttons should be disabled as long as we are not in the last and first page available.
5. If the user click twice on the same page, the results should be cached so there are few requests to the database.
6. The pagination should show 10 elements per page

## Assumptions
